# HexLogic
HexLogic aims to be a Python package, without dependencies outside of the built-in library, providing fully-documented functions to deal with the relations between objects on a hexagon tiled grid. Including conversion from „hexagonal“ to „pixel“ coordinates and pathfinding with varying movement cos. As well as various operations like line-drawing.
